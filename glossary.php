                                currency with the higher interest rate is said to be at a discount to the lower interest

                                from the spot rate. Similarly, the lower interest rate base currency is said to be at a
                                premium, and the forward points are added to the spot rate to obtain the forward rate.

                                underlying monetary policy suggests that controlling the growth of the amount of money
                                in the economy is the key to controlling prices and therefore inflation. However,
                                central banks’ monetary capability is severely limited by global money movements. This
                                forces them to use the indirect tool of exchange rate manipulation.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">A market conducted directly between dealers and principals via a telephone
                                and computer network rather than a regulated exchange trading floor. These markets have
                                not been very popular. They were never part of the Stock Exchange since they were seen
                                as “unofficial”. Each OTC firm operates a market in the shares of a restricted list of
                                (generally small and little-known) companies. Sometimes the dealer simply puts would-be
                                buyers and sellers together but does not take a position in the shares themselves. These
                                days OTC trading is seen as “consumer-friendly,” meaning that it is interested in
                                getting the buyer and seller the best possible price. Some see this as what
                                share-trading is all about. However, market makers, many of whom create market movements
                                purposefully, feel they are being elbowed out by OTC, and that speculation, arbitrage
                                and “smart-trading” are undermined by the new market.</p>

                            <p>For exchange contracts, it is the day on which the two contracting parties exchange the currencies which are being bought or sold.

                                For a spot transaction, it is two business banking days forward in the country of the bank providing quotations which determine the spot value date.
                                <br>
                                The only exception to this general rule is the spot day in the quoting centre coinciding with a banking holiday in the country/countries of the foreign currency/currencies. The value date then moves forward a day. The enquirer is the party who must make sure that his spot day coincides with the one applied by the respondent. The forward months maturity must fall on the corresponding date in the relevant calendar month.  If the one month date falls on a non-banking day in one of the centres, the operative date would be the next business day that is common. The adjustment of the maturity for a particular month does not effect the other maturities that will continue to fall on the original corresponding date if they meet the open day requirement. If the last spot date falls on the last business day of a month, the forward dates will match this date by also falling due on the last business day (also referred to as maturity date).
