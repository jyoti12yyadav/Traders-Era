                            <p class="mt-3">Prospective clients should study the below-mentioned risk warnings very
                                carefully. Please note that we do not explore or explain all the risks involved when
                                dealing in Financial Instruments (including Contracts for Difference “the CFDs” and
                                Equities). We simply outline the general nature of the risks of dealing in Financial
                                Instruments on a fair and non-misleading basis.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">In particular, Contracts for Difference (‘CFDs’) are complex financial
                                products and not suitable for all investors. CFDs are leveraged products that mature
                                when you choose to close an existing open position. By investing in CFDs, you assume a
                                high level of risk and can result in the loss of all of your invested capital.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Unless a client knows and fully understands the risks involved in each
                                Financial Instrument, they should not engage in any trading activity. You should not
                                risk more than you are prepared to lose. TradersEra will not provide clients with any
                                investment advice in relation to investments, possible transactions in investments, or
                                Financial Instruments, neither will we make any investment recommendations. Clients
                                should consider which Financial Instrument is suitable for them according to their
                                financial status and goals before opening an account with TradersEra. If a client is
                                unclear about the risks involved in trading in Financial Instruments, then they should
                                consult an independent financial advisor. If the client still doesn’t understand these
                                risks after consulting an independent financial advisor, then they should refrain from
                                trading at all. Purchasing and selling Financial Instruments comes with a significant
                                risk of losses and damages and each client must understand that the investment value can
                                both increase and decrease, clients they are liable for all these losses and damages,
                                which could result in more than the initial invested capital once they make the decision
                                has been made to trade.</p>

                                Differences. You should not deal in these products unless you understand their nature
                                and the extent of your exposure to risk. You should also be satisfied that the product
                                is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial position. Certain
                                strategies, such as a “spread” position or a “straddle”, may be as risky as a simple
                                Long or Short position.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Under Margin Trading conditions even small market movements may have a
                                great impact on the Client’s Trading Account. It is important to note that all accounts
                                trade under the effect of Leverage. The Client must consider that if the market moves
                                against the Client, the Client may sustain a total loss greater than the funds
                                deposited. The Client is responsible for all the risks, financial resources the Client
                                uses and for the chosen trading strategy.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">It is highly recommended that the Client maintains a Margin Level
                                (percentage Equity to Necessary Margin ratio which is calculated as Equity / Necessary
                                Margin * 100%) of not lower than 1,000%. It is also recommended to place Stop Loss to
                                limit potential losses, and Take Profit to collect profits, when it is not possible for
                                the Client to manage the Client’s Open Positions.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5"> The Client shall be responsible for all financial losses caused by the

                                as a result of a profitable position (cancelled by TradersEra afterwards) opened at an

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Some Instruments trade within wide intraday ranges with volatile price
                                movements. Therefore, the Client must carefully consider that there is a high risk of
                                losses as well as profits. The price of Derivative financial instruments is derived from
                                the price of the underlying asset in which the instruments refer to (for example
                                currency, stock, metals, indices, etc). Derivative financial instruments and related
                                markets can be highly volatile. The prices of instruments and the underlying asset may
                                fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes
                                in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the Client or TradersEra.

                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Under certain market conditions it may be impossible for a Client’s
                                order to be executed at declared price leading to losses. The prices of instruments and
                                the underlying asset will be influenced by, amongst other things, changing supply and
                                demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and
                                policies, national and international political and economic events and the prevailing
                                psychological characteristics of the relevant market place. Therefore, Stop Loss order
                                cannot guarantee the limit of loss.

                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">The Client acknowledges and accepts that, regardless of any information
                                which may be offered by TradersEra, the value of Instruments may fluctuate downwards or
                                upwards and it is even probable that the investment may become of no value. This is owed
                                to the margining system applicable to such trades, which generally involves a

                                relatively small movement in the underlying market can have a disproportionately

                                quickly result in the loss of the Client’s entire deposit, but may also expose the

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take,
                                delivery of the underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to
                                settle the position with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The gearing or leverage
                                often obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead
                                to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement can
                                lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this
                                can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a contingent
                                liability, and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the
                                margining requirements, which are set out below.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Buying options involves less risk than selling options because, if the
                                price of the underlying asset moves against you, you can simply allow the option to
                                lapse. The maximum loss is limited to the premium, plus any commission or other
                                transaction charges. However, if you buy a call option on a futures contract and you
                                later exercise the option, you will acquire the future. This will expose you to the
                                risks described under futures’ and contingent liability investment transactions.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If you write an option, the risk involved is considerably greater than
                                buying options. You may be liable for margin to maintain your position and a loss may be
                                sustained well in excess of the premium received. By writing an option, you accept a
                                legal obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset if the option is exercised
                                against you, however far the market price has moved away from the exercise price. If you
                                already own the underlying asset which you have contracted to sell (when the options
                                will be known as covered call options) the risk is reduced. If you do not own the
                                underlying asset (uncovered call options) the risk can be unlimited. Only experienced
                                persons should contemplate writing uncovered options, and then only after securing full

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Foreign markets involve various risks. On request, TradersEra must
                                provide an explanation of the relevant risks and protections (if any) which will operate
                                in any foreign markets, including the extent to which it will accept liability for any
                                default of a foreign firm through whom it deals. The potential for profit or loss from
                                transactions on foreign markets or in foreign denominated contracts will be affected by
                                fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. </p>

                            <h6 class="mb-4">Contingent Liability Investment Transactions</h6>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Contingent liability investment transactions, which are margined,
                                require you to make a series of payments against the purchase price, instead of paying
                                the whole purchase price immediately. The Margin requirement will depend on the
                                underlying asset of the instrument. Margin requirements can be fixed or calculated from
                                the current price of the underlying instrument, it can be found on the website of
                                TradersEra.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If you trade in futures, Contracts for Differences or sell options, you
                                may sustain a total loss of the funds you have deposited to open and maintain a
                                position. If the market moves against you, you may be called upon to pay substantial
                                additional funds at short notice to maintain the position. If you fail to do so within
                                the time required, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be responsible
                                for the resulting deficit.

                            </p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">It is noted that TradersEra will not have a duty to notify the Client for
                                any Margin Call to sustain a loss-making position.
                                Even if a transaction is not margin, it may still carry an obligation to make further
                                payments in certain circumstances over and above any amount paid when you entered the
                                contract.</p>

                                under the rules of a recognised or designated investment exchange may expose you to
                                substantially greater risks.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If you deposit collateral as security with TradersEra, the way in which
                                it will be treated will vary according to the type of transaction and where it is
                                traded. There could be significant differences in the treatment of your collateral
                                depending on whether you are trading on a recognised or designated investment exchange,
                                with the rules of that exchange (and the associated clearing house) applying, or trading
                                off-exchange. Deposited collateral may lose its identity as your property once dealings
                                on your behalf are undertaken. Even if your dealings should ultimately prove profitable,
                                you may not get back the same assets which you deposited, and may have to accept payment
                                in cash. You should ascertain from your firm how your collateral will be dealt with.</p>

                                charges are not expressed in monetary terms (but, for example, as a percentage of

                                for example because of changes in legislation or his personal circumstances. TradersEra
                                does not warrant that no tax and/or any other stamp duty will be payable. The Client is

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Under certain trading conditions it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This may occur, for example, at times of rapid price movement if the price rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that under the rules of the relevant exchange trading is suspended or restricted. </p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Placing a Stop Loss will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such an Order at the stipulated price. In addition, under certain market conditions the execution of a Stop Loss Order may be worse than its stipulated price and the realized losses can be larger than expected.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">On many exchanges, the performance of a transaction by your firm (or third party with whom it is dealing on your behalf) is guaranteed by the exchange or clearing house. However, this guarantee is unlikely in most circumstances to cover you, the Client, and may not protect you if your firm or another party defaults on its obligations to you. </p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">On request, TradersEra must explain any protection provided to you under the clearing guarantee applicable to any on-exchange derivatives in which you are dealing.
