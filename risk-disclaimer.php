                            <h5>1. Risk Warning</h5>
                            <p class="mt-3">Prospective clients should study the below-mentioned risk warnings very carefully. Please note that we do not explore or explain all the risks involved when dealing in Financial Instruments (including Contracts for Difference “the CFDs” and Equities). We simply outline the general nature of the risks of dealing in Financial Instruments on a fair and non-misleading basis.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">In particular, Contracts for Difference (‘CFDs’) are complex financial products and not suitable for all investors. CFDs are leveraged products that mature when you choose to close an existing open position. By investing in CFDs, you assume a high level of risk and can result in the loss of all of your invested capital.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Unless a client knows and fully understands the risks involved in each Financial Instrument, they should not engage in any trading activity. You should not risk more than you are prepared to lose. EndureFX will not provide clients with any investment advice in relation to investments, possible transactions in investments, or Financial Instruments, neither will we make any investment recommendations. Clients should consider which Financial Instrument is suitable for them according to their financial status and goals before opening an account with EndureFX. If a client is unclear about the risks involved in trading in Financial Instruments, then they should consult an independent financial advisor. If the client still doesn’t understand these risks after consulting an independent financial advisor, then they should refrain from trading at all. Purchasing and selling Financial Instruments comes with a significant risk of losses and damages and each client must understand that the investment value can both increase and decrease, clients they are liable for all these losses and damages, which could result in more than the initial invested capital once they make the decision has been made to trade.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">This notice cannot disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of foreign exchange and derivative products such as futures, options, and Contracts for Differences. You should not deal in these products unless you understand their nature and the extent of your exposure to risk. You should also be satisfied that the product is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial position. Certain strategies, such as a “spread” position or a “straddle”, may be as risky as a simple Long or Short position.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Although forex and derivative instruments can be used for the management of investment risk, some of these products are unsuitable for many investors. You should not engage in any dealings directly or indirectly in derivative products unless you know and understand the risks involved in them and that you may lose entirely all of your money. Different instruments involve different levels of exposure to risk and in deciding whether to trade in such instruments you should be aware of the following points:</p>
                           
                        </div>

                            <h6 class="mb-4" >Effect of Leverage</h6>
                           
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Under Margin Trading conditions even small market movements may have a great impact on the Client’s Trading Account. It is important to note that all accounts trade under the effect of Leverage. The Client must consider that if the market moves against the Client, the Client may sustain a total loss greater than the funds deposited. The Client is responsible for all the risks, financial resources the Client uses and for the chosen trading strategy.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">It is highly recommended that the Client maintains a Margin Level (percentage Equity to Necessary Margin ratio which is calculated as Equity / Necessary Margin * 100%) of not lower than 1,000%. It is also recommended to place Stop Loss to limit potential losses, and Take Profit to collect profits, when it is not possible for the Client to manage the Client’s Open Positions.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5"> The Client shall be responsible for all financial losses caused by the opening of the position using temporary excess Free Margin on the Trading Account gained as a result of a profitable position (cancelled by EndureFX afterwards) opened at an Error Quote (Spike) or at a Quote received as a result of a Manifest Error.</p>
                        </div>


                        <div class="privacy-policy__part">
                            <h6 class="mb-4" >High Volatile Instruments</h6>
                           
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Some Instruments trade within wide intraday ranges with volatile price movements. Therefore, the Client must carefully consider that there is a high risk of losses as well as profits. The price of Derivative financial instruments is derived from the price of the underlying asset in which the instruments refer to (for example currency, stock, metals, indices, etc). Derivative financial instruments and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of instruments and the underlying asset may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the Client or EndureFX. 

</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Under certain market conditions it may be impossible for a Client’s order to be executed at declared price leading to losses. The prices of instruments and the underlying asset will be influenced by, amongst other things, changing supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and the prevailing psychological characteristics of the relevant market place. Therefore, Stop Loss order cannot guarantee the limit of loss.

</p>
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">The Client acknowledges and accepts that, regardless of any information which may be offered by EndureFX, the value of Instruments may fluctuate downwards or upwards and it is even probable that the investment may become of no value. This is owed to the margining system applicable to such trades, which generally involves a comparatively modest deposit or margin in terms of the overall contract value, so that a relatively small movement in the underlying market can have a disproportionately dramatic effect on the Client’s trade. </p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If the underlying market movement is in the Client’s favour, the Client may achieve a good profit, but an equally small adverse market movement can not only quickly result in the loss of the Client’s entire deposit, but may also expose the Client to a large additional loss.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Some of the underlying assets may not become immediately liquid as a result of reduced demand for the underlying asset and the Client may not be able to obtain the information on the value of these or the extent of the associated risks.

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery of the underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the position with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The gearing or leverage often obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a contingent liability, and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the margining requirements, which are set out below.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">There are many different types of options with different characteristics subject to the conditions mentioned below:</p>
                        
                        </div>

                            <h6 class="mb-4" >Buying Options:</h6>
                           
                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Buying options involves less risk than selling options because, if the price of the underlying asset moves against you, you can simply allow the option to lapse. The maximum loss is limited to the premium, plus any commission or other transaction charges. However, if you buy a call option on a futures contract and you later exercise the option, you will acquire the future. This will expose you to the risks described under futures’ and contingent liability investment transactions.</p>
                        
                        </div>
                        <div class="privacy-policy__part">

                            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If you write an option, the risk involved is considerably greater than buying options. You may be liable for margin to maintain your position and a loss may be sustained well in excess of the premium received. By writing an option, you accept a legal obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset if the option is exercised against you, however far the market price has moved away from the exercise price. If you already own the underlying asset which you have contracted to sell (when the options will be known as covered call options) the risk is reduced. If you do not own the underlying asset (uncovered call options) the risk can be unlimited. Only experienced persons should contemplate writing uncovered options, and then only after securing full details of the applicable conditions and potential risk exposure.</p>
                        
                        </div>
                        <h6 class="mb-4" >Contracts for Differences</h6>
                           
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-5">The CFDs available for trading with EndureFX are non-deliverable spot transactions giving an opportunity to make profit on changes in currency rates, commodity, stock market indices or share prices called the underlying instrument. </p>
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-5">If the underlying instrument movement is in the Client’s favour, the Client may achieve a good profit, but an equally small adverse market movement can not only quickly result in the loss of the Client’s entire deposit but also any additional table-accordion commissions and other expenses incurred. So, the Client must not enter into CFDs unless he is willing to undertake the risks of losing entirely all the money which he has invested and also any additional table-accordion commissions and other expenses incurred.</p>
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-5">
Investing in a Contract for Differences carries the same risks as investing in a future or an option and you should be aware of these as set out above. Transactions in Contracts for Differences may also have a contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of this as set out below.</p>
                       
                       </div>

                       <h6 class="mb-4" >Equities</h6>
                           
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Equities represent a portion of a company’s share capital. The extent of the Client’s ownership in a company depends on the number of shares the Client owns in relation to the total number of shares in issue.

</p>
                           <p class="mt-4 mb-5">Shares are bought and sold on stock exchanges and their values can go down. In respect of shares in smaller companies, there is an extra risk of losing money when such shares are bought or sold. There can be a big difference between the buying and selling price of these shares.
If they have to be sold immediately, the Clients may get back much less than they paid for them. Shares in companies incorporated in emerging markets may be harder to buy and sell than those shares in companies in more developed markets and such companies may also not be regulated as strictly.</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-5">All Equities offered are listed on an exchange, which means that the prices are not set by EndureFX. EndureFX will act on any instruction that the Client provides to buy or sell an instrument on his/her behalf in accordance with EndureFX obligation to provide best execution as set out in the order execution policy, to act reasonably and in accordance with the applicable Client Agreement and other Operative Agreements.

</p>
<p class="mt-4 mb-5">EndureFX may place the Client’s instructions to deal outside of an exchange if this is in line with the order execution policy.
