                                open and honest regarding the refund cancellation procedure. Money can be taken from a
                                client's trading account at any moment. TradersEra promises to fulfil redemption
                                requests from clients on time, usually within one or two business days. Customers are
                                encouraged to ensure all information on the redemption form, including the invoice
                                number, order number, and reason for the refund, is accurate and complete to speed up
                                the process.
                                Before transferring funds to a client's trading account, TradersEra must confirm that
                                the sender is a registered client; if not, the company reserves the right to return the
                                total amount received by the remitter using the same form of payment.

                                on the registered account. The client must receive consent from the TradersEra
                                Compliance Department if the name mentioned differs. The original credit card used at
                                the time of purchase will be credited with the refund if the payment was made with a
                                credit card.

                                compensated to the customer. This does not, however, apply if the customer gave
                                TradersEra incorrect instructions or information; in that instance, the client might be
                                responsible for the loss.
