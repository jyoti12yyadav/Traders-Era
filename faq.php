                                    <p>When you open a trade, you do it at the Ask price for Buy trades or at the Bid
                                        price for Sell trades. If you were to close the trade, the opposite price is
                                        used — the Bid price to close a Buy trade and the Ask price to close a Sell
                                        trade. The same applies for calculating the trade's floating profit or loss.
                                        Hence, when opening a new trade, it always starts in the red due to the Bid/Ask
                                        spread. This is why, every traders must first beat the spread for their
                                        positions to become profitable.</p>
